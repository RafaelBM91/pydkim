The verify() function needs to handle rsa-sha1 correctly.

The l= (length) tag needs to be handled appropriately in both sign() and
verify().

Validation of all parsing in verify() (check regular expressions match etc).

Check for length of signing hash compared to the length of the RSA modulus.

Handle multiple DKIM-Signature header lines.

It should be possible to remove the dependency on dnspython by using something
like dig.

Better debug logging output.
