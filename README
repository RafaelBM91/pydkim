http://hewgill.com/pydkim/

OBSOLETE

This repository is the last release of pydkim from 2008. The latest version
is a fork found at dkimpy in Launchpad and is under active development:
https://launchpad.net/dkimpy

INTRODUCTION

pydkim is a library that implements DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) email
signing and verification.

VERSION

This is pydkim 0.3.

REQUIREMENTS

Python 2.5 or later is required.
The dnspython library (http://www.dnspython.org) library is required.

The library will operate in a degraded mode under Python 2.4, where only
the SHA-1 algorithm is used for signing and available for verification.
This is because the hashlib module that offers SHA-256 is available from
Python 2.5 onwards.

INSTALLATION

To build and install pydkim:

    python setup.py install

USAGE

The pydkim library offers one module called dkim. The sign() function takes an
RFC822 formatted message, along with some signing options, and returns a
DKIM-Signature header line that can be prepended to the message. The verify()
function takes an RFC822 formatted message, and returns True or False depending
on whether the signature verifies correctly.

For full documentation, see: http://hewgill.local/pydkim/html/

Two helper programs are also supplied: dkimsign.py and dkimverify.py.

dkimsign.py is a filter that reads an RFC822 message on standard input, and
writes the same message on standard output with a DKIM-Signature line
prepended. The signing options are specified on the command line:

dkimsign.py selector domain privatekeyfile [identity]

The identity is optional and defaults to "@domain".

dkimverify.py reads an RFC822 message on standard input, and returns with exit
code 0 if the signature verifies successfully. Otherwise, it returns with exit
code 1.
